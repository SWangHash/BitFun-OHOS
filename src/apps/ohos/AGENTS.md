# HarmonyOS host

This directory owns the ArkTS host and platform bridges. Follow the root
`AGENTS.md` for shared product behavior and Windows/WSL build boundaries.

## Secure credential bridge

`SecureCredentialStore.ets` returns Base64 secret bytes to Rust. The legacy
market alias `bitfun.market.credentials.v1` can still contain UTF-8 JSON from
`MarketCredentialStore`. Keep reading both formats without rewriting an asset
during load. Let the Rust market store validate the credential payload; do not
apply the legacy conversion to subscription chunks or other aliases.

The 2.0.0 Rust account store (`account_identity/credentials.rs`) reads the
current alias `bitfun.market.credentials.v1` first and falls back to the
1.0.x alias above, so an in-place upgrade keeps the market sign-in. Sign-out
deletes both aliases. Keep the two aliases in step with the bridge constant
`LEGACY_MARKET_ASSET_ALIAS` when either side is renamed.

Run the focused bridge regression tests from the repository root in WSL after
installing the root JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
node --test src/apps/ohos/tests/secure-credential-store.test.cjs
```

The tests transpile the production bridge and mock AssetStoreKit and ArkTS
utilities. They cover stored-format compatibility and bridge behavior, not
HarmonyOS permissions, ArkTS compilation, or device execution. Use the
`bitfun-ohos-build` preflight/build workflow when a HAP is required.

For device-local automatic-startup queries and API-gated idle sleep prevention, run
`node --test src/apps/ohos/tests/desktop-system.test.cjs`. These mocked host tests
cover version gating and lock lifecycle, not OS permission grants or device behavior.
