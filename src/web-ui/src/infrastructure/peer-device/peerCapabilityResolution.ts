/**
 * Resolve whether the currently rendered surface can be queried for the
 * read-only tool catalog (`get_all_tools_info`), so the UI skips the invoke
 * when the host can't answer it instead of masking the unsupported error as an
 * empty list.
 *
 * - Local surface: always `true`.
 * - `toolCatalog === true`: advertised by the host → `true`.
 * - `toolCatalog === false`: host explicitly unsupported → `false`.
 * - `toolCatalog === null` (older host that did not advertise the field):
 *   resolve by `hostKind`. An old Desktop always implemented the catalog
 *   (`true`); an old CLI never did (`false`). `hostKind === null` (truly
 *   unknown / still probing) stays optimistic.
 *
 * `cancel_tool` is resolved by the same rule when a consumer needs it. The
 * Terminal Interrupt button that used to consume it left with the legacy
 * TerminalControl tool; hosts keep advertising the capability for older
 * controllers that still render that button. See PR #2428 round 5 #1.
